# What does Project Management gives you

* Experience in high profile project management.
* A line to your CV/resume about the important job you do. Enterprises **love** that kind of stuff.
* You can earn money by fixing bugs and adding features for others. We help you on the financial side of things.
* Deep knowledge about how code automation works in GitHub repos. We'll teach you and guide though.
* We would endorse you in every way possible.

# Project manager obligations

Project manager (PM) is someone who:

* Triages all the incoming issues ASAP.
* Provides non-breaking security fixes.
* Commited to do it forever. Or...
* Finds replacement for themself if can't do the project management any more.

## Issue triaging

PM must receive (push?) notifications about new issues in their project(s). There are few ways: [emails](https://github.com/settings/notifications), [web browser](https://github.com/settings/notifications) notifications, [desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [mobile](https://github.com/mobile/) app notifictions.

PM must triage the issue and reply ASAP. On a weekday the maximum reply delay must be 24 hours. It's okay to not triage on weekends and holidays.

There are 5 issue labels in each project - security, compatibility, bug, enhancement, feature. Apply them immediately.

Close all issues unless labelled as "security".

Never forbid discussions in any of the issues.

## Security fixes

As soon as a security bug was reported the PM must do everything possible to publish a new non-breaking version of the software ASAP. If can't then PM must actively seek help.

But please note, that mntnd projects are likely automated to do most of the work for you. Especially we hope to apply vulnerable sub-dependency upgrades without PM involvement.

## Commitment

You commit to do your project managent thing forever.

We understand that nothing is forever. Workarounds are possible.

## PM replacment

A project must never live without a PM. Thus, if you intend to lay down your PM obligations - you must find yourself a replacement, a new PM who would agree to these conditions.

# Recommendations to PMs

## Do not take much on you

Take 1 large or few small project only. Even if you have free time to manage 10 large projects simultaneously we don't want you to burn out. We care about you. Also, if you manage too many projects - this is a high risk for us. We can't take it. We tend to mitigate risks earlier.

We encourage you making as much money as possible by maintaining a mntnd project. We'll try helping you here.
